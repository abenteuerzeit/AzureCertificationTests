## Cloud Fundumentals

1. When you need to provision a resource within the cloud, om-demand resourcing makes it almost immediately available to you to allocate where and when you need it.
- On-demand resourcing provides you with the ability to provision resources within seconds and minutes, instead of days or weeks that it may take within an on-premise environment, especially if you had to order the additional hardware first. For example, if you had a server in the Cloud and its CPU utilization was steadily increasing with demand, you would be able to deploy a second server, which would be ready within minutes to take some of the load off of the first.

2. Compute resources provide the ‘brains’ to process your workloads, including what is required to process and run requests from applications.
- Compute objects provide the brains to process your workload. Including what's required to process a run request from applications and services. As a comparison, if you think of hardware devices with CPUs and RAM, typically servers and how they work in a classic, on-premises environment, compute resources in a cloud, are comparable to these. 

3. A public cloud deployment model is where a vendor makes available the use of shared infrastructure, including compute, storage and network resources, that can be provisioned on demand and typically accessed over the internet.
- Public clouds allow for users to access remote resources on-demand, which is accessed over the internet. Anyone can gain access to the vendors’ resources as long as they sign up to the service. Private, hybrid and community clouds are restricted on access.

4. How are costs generally charged for public cloud resources? Consumption-based metering where you only pay for what you use
- Charges are based on consumption so the business areas will not be paying over and above what was utilized. Remember we only pay for what we use. Billing and utilization reports can be generated for each customer and department that are utilizing cloud services. Internally this helps with departmental budgetary requirements
